# Measurement and Role of Emotions in Political Communication During the Ukraine War
The repository contains the code for my master's dissertation titled "Measurement and Role of Emotions in Online Political Communication During the Ukraine War." Essentially, I am developing a novel unsupervised labeling framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and word embeddings into a two-stage labeling process. I validate this method with human coders from Amazon's Mechanical Turk and apply this new tool to analyze President Zelenskyy's Telegram messages during the Ukraine-Russian war.

The dissertation was selected by the Department of Methodology's Program Director as one of the three best examples for future cohorts.
